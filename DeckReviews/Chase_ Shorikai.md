# Shorikai Deck Review

[Decklist](https://www.moxfield.com/decks/HaLyW06Em0KYPGkvYOiEjg)

## Deck Direction

I think you're straddling the line between a few different archetypes. They're somewhat overlapping so you could easily play two (or even three) of them, but it might be helpful to figure out which one you see as the primary focus and which ones you'll just fit in as you can.

Of the three - I think my _personal_ pick would be to lean more in the direction of a big UW Control deck with some artifact themes, but completely up to you how you'd build it.

### UW Big Mana Control

Since your commander is not a creature, you can lean into the fact that you can have your commander online and still be actively deploying board sweepers regularly while accruing value. Overall the goal is to have a small number of very impactful threats in play and then if you feel as though your opponents have deployed a large amount of resources to get around your threat, you reset and deploy a new one.

### UW Tempo

Sort of the opposite of the former one, you'd want to have a large number of small plays that incrementally develop your board/generate card advantage while slowing down your opponents. This is the "total is greater than the sum of it's parts" kind of deck.

### UW Artifacts

This one can easily fit in with either of the first two - but just leaning into some of the artifact synergy cards to generate you some additional value (which the decklist already does). Mostly mentioning it because I think if you wanted to REALLY lean into this you could not even worry about the first two archetypes and just be an artifact/vehicles deck.

## Mana

Lots of good here, but a few outliers that could maybe be more focused a few solid mana pieces to add:

* I just think [Worn Powerstone]() feels really good in this list. You have a lot of impactful 5 and 6 mana plays, and even outside of that turn 3 Powerstone into turn 4 Commander + Activate seems worth the inclusion.
* If you want to lean more into the UW Control I would cut [Foundry Inspector]() and [Etherium Sculptor]() and instead put in [Thran Dynamo]() and maybe even [Guilded Lotus]().
* Overall I actually really like the [Voltaic Key]() and [Manifold Key]() as a way os accelerating your mana with these bigger mana docks. If you want to lean into that I could see [Trinket Mage]() finding a spot, and this could even be a good deck for [Artificer's Intuition]() since you have some graveyard synergies and it can pick up the keys as well as a few of your other rocks. Could even consider putting in some silver bullets like [Tormod's Crypt]() or [Pithing Needle]() since if you draw them and don't need them you can just loot them away with commander.
* I'm personally on a little bit of a crusade against [Though Vessel](). I think it _feels_ really good to have in play, and it's hard to argue that 2 mana rocks are ever bad, but I think too many people overvalue no hand limit, when realistically you want to build your deck so that if you can't find a set of 7 cards that you think can beat your opponents you shouldn't be including some of those cards in your deck.
* It's not directly related to mana, but I think [Indomitable Archangel]() is a very powerful effect, but also it doesn't synergize with a lot of your deck. Specifically any of the untap effects, or the [Skullclamp]().

## Cutting the Low End

* Speaking of [Skullclamp](), I'm on the fence about it. I think in general you don't want to be playing the kind of creatures in your deck that give it the most value (X/1 come into play or die effects). But the fact that your commander generates 1/1s means that it's likely worth it for that alone. It just means that if you want to be using that for value you might be giving up some of your ability to crew as many vehicles and you want to treat them as toolbox threats instead of just swarming an army of beaters.
* On a similar note, I think [Hotshot Mechanic]() just feels too narrow to me. It would be good if you're trying to rush out a bunch of vehicles, but I would lean towards playing the deck a little bit slower, rather than just an early drop that will likely get swept up in a board wipe later.
* [Sram, Senior Edificer]() has a similar issue. You want to play it early, but it's probably going to be 4-5 turns before you draw even 1-2 cards. I would add either a "stickier" or "more consistent" card draw engine, or a strong 1-time card draw effect in this slot.
* [Lita, Mechanical Engineer]() is pretty cute int he deck, and if you really want to be a vehicle deck I think it's completely fine, but on a similar line I think you're going to have more vehicles to crew than you will have... pilots? So if you need to free up space for any of the suggestions below I think that this could go.

## Additions

If you want to lean more into that bigger mana - this is some of the additions I would look to fit in (in no particular order):

### Big Threats / Creatures

* [Sun Titan]() Synergizes with the commander looting, lets you even ramp by discarding a land and then attacking to put it into play.
* [Thought Monitor]() I think this could be a potential replacement for Saram. It's probably not even that expensive to case for you. Can crew a vehicle, and if it dies and comes back you're quite happy with that.
* [Consecrated Sphinx]() doesn't really synergize with the artifacts, but it's just such a monster for card advantage.
* [Cataclysmic Gearhulk]() lets you break the symmetry since the idea is your average card of each type is higher value than your opponents. A good way to slow down either a deck rushing you or just trying to build up a huge amount of value. Doesn't impact your vehicle plan at all.
* I don't know if I actually believe this, but this might be the deck for [Darksteel Juggernaut](). It survives boardwipes, and if you don't want to attack you can just crew something big with it. To a (much) lesser extend [Darksteel Sentinal]()
* Now that I'm thinking about indestructible creatures. [Ephara, God of the Polis]() qualifies, and also synergizes REALLY well with your commander, especially with the untap effects.
* [Sharding Sphinx]() another option to just build up an army from a single card/threat.

### Counterspells / Interaction

* [Arcane Denial]() might be arguably better than [Counterspell]() or [Dovin's Veto](). Since counterspell puts your an your opponents at -1 and -1 relative to the table's 0, 0 (so net -2), and Arcane Denial puts you at 0 and +1 (net -1). Also lets you "cycle" a useless card + Arcane denial for +3 cards in a pinch.
* I would look for maybe 1-2 more sweepers to fit in. [Cyclonic Rift]() is a classic, and my personal old favorite is [Rout]().

### General Synergies

* I think [Jace, Vryn's Prodigy]() could git really cleanly into the deck. Helps you back up card selection early game, and then flips to be a planeswalker to synergize with commander's discard and dodge your own wraths later.
* [Argivian Restoration]() is a cute way to cheat mana cost or recur something you want back.
* You're already running [Academy Ruins]() so you could slot [Mindslaver]() into the list if you are feeling spicy.
* [Phyrexian Metamorph]() and [Shimmer Myr]() are just two pretty solid staples in artifact decks.
