# Archelos Landstorm

## Objectives

### Gameplay Objective

Make multiple land drops a turn, use a combination of extra land drops/cards that put lands into play with untap effects to make landfalls feel like rituals or other spells.

### Gameplay Objective

Always feel like you have a lot of options due to the amount of mana you have available, develop a board state that is resistant to most board wipes.

### Deckbuilding Objective

Most cards should feel like they function on their own - but synergize with other cards for greater effect.

## Deckbuilding

### Repeating Landfalls
