## My Decklist

URw Twin/Time Vault
https://www.moxfield.com/decks/1iEWcWQt20GxF1ncd24ZyA

### Draft Notes
* First picked Thief of Sanity, passed only Green card in 1st pack (Library?)
* Picked up Time Vault early (1st Pack?)
* Started looking for Dimir, then moved into Esper control but got cut hard Black, and eventually White
* Was passed a late (6th, 7th pick) Fractured Identity in first pack
* Picked up Deceived Somewhere in the first pack, I believe that pack is where I passed on Conscripts
* Picked something else over Pestermite, which didn't table
* 2nd Pack Moved into UR, picked up Kiki and Twin
* Got a last pick Plow Under from the left which made me question if he was in Green (he was)
* Power Pack was opened 2 seats to my right. Picks were Ancestral -> Mana Vault -> Sol Ring (me) -> Lotus -> Jet/Ruby -> Jet/Ruby -> Time Walk -> Sapphire -> Pearl? -> Emerald (me)
* Took a very late Voltaic Key in this pack
