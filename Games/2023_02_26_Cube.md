## Draft

Going into the draft I was looking for Blue based artifacts (w/ Tinker), UR Wildfire, or some U based Planeswalker list (UR, Esper, or UBG). I felt that decks were going to be very strong, and didn't want to rely on key combos (Twin, Storm, Doomsday) would make it to me with people having so many opportunities to hate out cards with such a large card pool. I also anticipated people might get greedy with their manabases, so playing something artifact based with some minor stax or land destruction themes seems both unlikely people would go for those strategies as well as them being pretty flexible to transition into each other (Artifact ramp works well with wildfire, wildfire/armageddon works well with planeswalkers, etc).

I would say overall the draft went... poorly, and I got saved by a few lucky picks. P1P1 was Tolarian Academy, picking up early Metalworker, Some 2 mana rocks, Snapcaster, and Theiving Skydiver. I notably passed a Wheel of Fortune (didn't wheel), and 2 one mana green dorks (that did), Rofellos (that didn't) and Primevil Titan (which did). It felt like Green was very open. My first pack also had the Academy and 3 very good blue cards that I passed, which made me feel like I was giving bad signals and a lot of them didn't wheel.

At the end of Pack 1 I had picked up my first Wildfire, some Titan + 2 Mana Dorks, and Sundering Titan (felt good in both decks). Felt like I was split between 2 decks but figured with 3 packs left maybe that was okay to commit to one more slowly.

Pack 2 notable picks were a Thran Dyanmo (picked over Grim Monolith in the same pack), 2nd Wildfire, Crucible, Strip Mine (I think this was Pack 2?), Walking Ballista, and the Lore Keeper. (this was maybe a 3rd or 4th Pick?). I had Snapcaster so I considered one of the Blue Cards, but I didn't have great fixing at this point to feel confidant I would be able to splash it in a green deck - and I thought Sol Ring was stronger in both a Wildfire list and Artifact list. My deck didn't feel so unfair that Black Lotus would pay-off, and the best single card I had to ramp out was probably Primevil Tital (then Sundering Titan) both of which I was fine delaying one turn with Sol Ring). I hoped in 6 people I would be able to wheel a Blue Spell from that pack, but was pretty happy with Mana Vault - though I probably over-estimated it with how slow my plan was. I got a late pick Natural order here as well. I also passed a Ramanup (maybe for the Lore Keeper?) which didn't come around.

Pack 3 is probably what saved me, I got maybe 5th pick Dark Depths followed by Thespian Stage. At this point I'd given up on being the "Traditional" Green creatures deck, and was looking for things like a Cradle, Tinker, or more creatures to go with Natural Order. Somewhere in the end of this pack or P4 I picked up the Knight, Reclaimer, and Armageddon and thought I was going to go somewhere in a lands matter deck - but felt pretty bad about Green mana dorks combined with wildfires, and my general lack of finishers (aside from Depths) in Tinker cheese, Planeswalkers, etc. (This is also where I was looking for Crop Rotation, forgetting that it wasn't in the cube).
