# Cube Ideas

_Note: Looking at these from a strictly power level perspective. A lot of reasons to choose/not choose cards based on personal preference or design choices_

### In: Underworld Breach
_Synergizes with: LED, Black Lotus, Brain Freeze_

Fits nicely into storm, but also can be it's own combo with Brain Freeze and/or if you have either Lotus or LED. LED Feels like it's almost never a first round pick from the Power Pack so that seems like a pretty safe pick up if you get the Underworld Breach. Fits into Storm, Mono Red for some reach, UR or RG for value.

_Out: Doomnsday - Fills the same space with an Oracle Combo as this + Brain Freeze, and is another sub-combo theme_

### In: Minsc & Boo

Feels like an almost strict upgrade over Bloodbraid Elf in all the places you would play that card
_Out: Bloodbraid Elf_

### In: Wrenn and Six
_Synergizes with: Fetch Lands, Depths + Stage, Strip/Wasteland_

Helps RG/Jund fight against rush decks or U based fliers, as well as slowing down/stopping opposing planeswalkers

_Out: I'm not sure why there are only 2 Gruul cards, but I think this adds more to Lands/General use than Manamorphose does to storm, or if you feel like 3 effects is too many I would say this is stronger than both Ramunap and Crucible. Otherwise I would cut an artifact for it._

### In: Miscalculation

Feels good in both tempo based U decks as well as control based U decks. I feel like you put in Memory Lapse over this (which I actually thing was great).
_Out: I actually think Gush doesn't have a lot of support in your cube, and aside from a "free spell on the turn storm is going off" it feels weak. If you wanted to cut a counterspell I would play this over Negate_

### In: Council's Judgement

Seems almost a strict upgrade over Oblivion Ring, and I would play it over Faith's Fetters in most situations. (Helps more against: Elesh Norn, Consecrated Sphinx, Inkwell, Titania, lines up better against 3CMC walkers, and deals with static effects on Enchantments/Artifacts)
_Out: Fetters I think is weaker than Oblivion Ring so I'd vote that_
