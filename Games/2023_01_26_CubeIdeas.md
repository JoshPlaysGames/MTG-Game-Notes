# Cube Ideas

_Note: Looking at these from a strictly power level perspective. A lot of reasons to choose/not choose cards based on personal preference or design choices_

### In: Underworld Breach
_Synergizes with: LED, Black Lotus, Brain Freeze_

Fits nicely into storm, but also can be it's own combo with Brain Freeze and/or if you have either Lotus or LED. LED Feels like it's almost never a first round pick from the Power Pack so that seems like a pretty safe pick up if you get the Underworld Breach. Fits into Storm, Mono Red for some reach, UR or RG for value.

_Out: Doomnsday - Fills the same space with an Oracle Combo as this + Brain Freeze, and is another sub-combo theme_

### In: Minsc & Boo

Feels like an almost strict upgrade over Bloodbraid Elf in all the places you would play that card
_Out: Bloodbraid Elf_

### In: Archon of Cruelty

This seems like either the best or second best reanimator/sneak target after maybe Griselbrand. I would use the spot from taking out Doomsday to fit this in, and then either cut a Red 4 Drop or Fireball.

### In: Wrenn and Six
_Synergizes with: Fetch Lands, Depths + Stage, Strip/Wasteland_

Helps RG/Jund fight against rush decks or U based fliers, as well as slowing down/stopping opposing planeswalkers

_Out: I'm not sure why there are only 2 Gruul cards, but I think this adds more to Lands/General use than Manamorphose does to storm, or if you feel like 3 effects is too many I would say this is stronger than both Ramunap and Crucible. Otherwise I would cut an artifact for it._

### In: Teferi, Time Raveller, Teferi, Hero of Dominaria

If you think these are unfun/too strong I'd get it, but they synergize really well with a balance based UWx deck, and also work both defensively if you're behind, to generate advantage in a stalemate, and help you capitalize on an advantage if you're ahead.

_Out: I'm pretty meh on Geist as it seems like the UW deck is going to be slower, and the closest you'd get is URw splashing it. Sphinx's Rev is a fine card but I would say both of these are stronger._

### In: Miscalculation

Feels good in both tempo based U decks as well as control based U decks. I feel like you put in Memory Lapse over this (which I actually think was great).
_Out: I actually think Gush doesn't have a lot of support in your cube, and aside from a "free spell on the turn storm is going off" it feels weak. If you wanted to cut a counterspell I would play this over Negate_

I would also play Gitaxian Probe for the free spell slot over gush, and let you know if it's safe to go for a combo.

### In: Council's Judgement

Seems almost a strict upgrade over Oblivion Ring, and I would play it over Faith's Fetters in most situations. (Helps more against: Elesh Norn, Consecrated Sphinx, Inkwell, Titania, lines up better against 3CMC walkers, and deals with static effects on Enchantments/Artifacts)
_Out: Fetters I think is weaker than Oblivion Ring so I'd vote that_

### In: Riftwing Cloudscate

In the same way, I would say that this seems better than Aether Channeler in most Scenarios? I haven't played with Channeler too much so I'm less sure of this but you don't really have any Blink synergies, and early suspend feels like it lines up better with blue bouncing a threat for free and then deploying their own threat. Also flying seems relevant both to deal with planeswalkers or just (slowly) close out games.
_Out: Aether Channeler_

## Cards to fit In
These are mostly cards that I think are stronger than the cards in the cube currently, but I'm not sure exactly the swaps
 * Fable of the Mirror Breaker
 * Solitude
 * Crop Rotation
 * Sheoldrid the Apocalypse
 * Endurance
 * Unholy Heat
 * Light up the Stage
 * Temporary Lockdown (Helps against aggro - but also signets/talisman)
 * Uro (Seems stronger than Trygon)

## Simple Swaps
In: Runaway Steam-Kin, Out: Kargen Dragonlord
In: Murder, Out: Heartless Act
In: Fatal Push, Out: Infernal Grasp
In: Goldspan Dragon > Glorybringer, Out: Thundermaw Hellkit
In: Consider, Out: Opt
